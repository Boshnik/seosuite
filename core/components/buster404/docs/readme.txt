What’s a 404Buster?
No-one wants a 404-alert, which tells you the webpage you’re looking for, can’t be found. However, this is a fairly common issue for anyone who’s getting a new website. To work around this problem, there’s the 404Buster. A tool that makes sure the visitors are redirected to a relevant page, when they’re looking for an old URL.

How does it work?
A 404Buster can be used with .csv, .xls, or .xlsx files. In these files, you can place the URL’s of the pages that are no longer reachable and consequently, would give you the dreaded 404. This is done by copying and pasting the full URL. The tool will then check if there’s a relevant page it can be redirected to. The 404Buster will check after the final slash (/) of the URL. When this isn’t found, the tool will give suggestions from which you can choose.

Once properly uploaded, the URL’s will be automatically linked to the relevant pages. This will be done at the SEO tab of the specific page.

Why should I want this?
Because you don’t want many - if any - 404’s on your website. It’s annoying for the visitors and bad for your ranking in Google. The better this is tackled, the better your website is.
